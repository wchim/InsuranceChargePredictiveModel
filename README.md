## Insurance Charge Predictive Model
For our final group project we used the Medical Cost Personal Dataset to attempt to build a predictive model that forecasts insurance charge based on the patient's gender, BMI, number of children, smoking habit, and region. (https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance/version/1#_=_)
